        <h2>About the Family</h2>
        <p>Family Marketing is a brother–sister team based in Central Kentucky. We know what you might be thinking — we’re young, and we haven’t been doing this as long as you’ve been running your business. You’re right. But that’s exactly what makes us <span class="keyword-underline">different.</span>
<br>We grew up in a world where marketing changes every week, so adapting is second nature to us. We don’t rely on <em>the way it’s always been done.</em> We focus on what works now by testing, learning, and finding simple, smart ways to help local businesses grow.
<br>At the end of the day, our goal isn’t to impress you with buzzwords or big promises. It’s to earn your trust, make your marketing clear and effective, and help your business stand out with strategies that actually make sense.</p>
